# Wide-Resnet-28-10 Tensorflow implementation

The code achieves about 95.56% accuracy in 120 epochs on CIFAR10 dataset, which is similar to the original PyTorch version of the code used in the paper "Wide Residual Networks" (BMVC 2016) http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146 by Sergey Zagoruyko and Nikos Komodakis.
